# Intro to Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax, GFM, that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.
