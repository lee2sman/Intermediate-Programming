# Generative Processes

So far in this course we have covered:

* javascript and working with the DOM
* ES6
* the debugging process
* working with the Linux command line
* node and NPM packages
* creating routes and APIs with Express
* creating apps or *skills* with Amazon Alexa
* deploying projects to remote servers
* app persistence
* building your own generative bot
* working with data APIs and creating visualizations
* the foundations of working with other languages

Look back at your assignments for the semester and pick one to extend or go deeper into. For the final project of this course, you will extend one of your earlier programs to allow persistence. You can create a generative interactive program such as a painting program, story writer, multiplayer game, website or service. You can use Alexa, write to a website, or create a web app.

Your app/program must include:
* A useable, attractive and navigable interface and design
* a clear concept and use-case
* it must allow data persistence such as saving images, winner names and scoreboard, sound creation
* it must hook into an API to send and/or receive data in a meaningful capacity
* It must have a dedicated website with landing (home) page, about, and credits and a way to launch/download/use the application
* The project must be published online, and have source code and documentation on a live github repository. The project can be published to GitHub pages or another server.
