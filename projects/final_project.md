# Generative Processes

So far in this course we have covered:

* javascript and working with the DOM
* ES6
* the debugging process
* working with the Linux command line
* node and NPM packages
* creating routes and APIs with Express
* creating apps or *skills* with Amazon Alexa
* deploying projects to remote servers
* app persistence
* building your own generative bot
* working with data APIs and creating visualizations
* the foundations of working with other languages

Look back at your assignments for the semester and pick one to extend or go deeper into. For the final project of this course, you will extend one of your earlier programs to allow persistence. You can create a generative interactive program such as a painting program, story writer, multiplayer game, website or service. You can use Alexa, write to a website, or create a web app.

Your app/program must include:
* A useable, attractive and navigable interface and design
* a clear concept and use-case
* it must allow data persistence such as saving images, winner names and scoreboard, sound creation
* it must hook into an API to send and/or receive data in a meaningful capacity
* It must have a dedicated website with landing (home) page, about, and credits and a way to launch/download/use the application
* The project must be published online, and have source code and documentation on a live github repository. The project can be published to GitHub pages or another server.

# Consider some of these frameworks

* Building an online networked game - clone of [Agar.io](http://agar.io/) - video tutorials - [Game mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXuxYMGe4KI) and [multiplayer networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjVyKXp9hec)  - Uses P5JS and node and socket.io
* Making a game with [P5Play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org) - [example](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=collisions4.js) - uses p5js and p5play
* Make a choose-your-own-adventure style game with Alexa.

# Warm-up

Hi, I updated the final project page.

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, and by MONDAY at the latest:

Email me:

1. final project title
2. 1-3 sentence description
3. What frameworks and/or example code are you using
4. OPTIONAL: sketches and/or links to example images online

## NEW RESOURCES

*Have you been unable to come up with a project idea?* 

PICK ONE OF THE BELOW:

1. Consider making a multiplayer game

    A tutorial for building a clone of Agar.io style multiplayer game with p5js on the page linked above!

2. Make a twitter bot that works with an API

    You know how to do this! You've made bots! You've worked with APIs! Figure out a good combo! (Tweeting out pictures, high scores, art, weather, etc)

3. Make a better example of your Alexa project, or build a multi-choice adventure game with Alexa

    Examples and links to starter code with p5js on the page linked above!

EMAIL ME THE ABOVE ANSWERS to the questions I posed by Monday! Thanks!
