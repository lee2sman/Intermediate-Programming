# Project 1

## Visualization and queries with APIs


Your Project 1 assignment is to create a web-based project of your choice. It must use an API, and use live data from that API to change or modify your rendered canvas/sketch and/or website (through the DOM). You may use Javascript and P5JS. Your web project should be deployed online, such as on GitHub pages.

Your project will be graded on:

1. Presentation
  * Is the design pleasing and compelling?
  * Does it use the data in a novel way?
  * Is it easy to understand what is going on?
  * Is the concept unique?
2. Completeness
  * Do you fulfill all of the requirements?
  * Use JSON from an online API and use that data to alter a canvas element or website
  * Deploy your site online
3. Functionality
  * Does your code work completely?
  * Is it user-friendly/clear?

Bonus points:
- Include a meaningful way to interact with the sketch/website.
